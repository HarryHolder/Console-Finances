# Console-Finances

## Description

I was tasked with using only javaScript to work out several financial calculations. It involved using newly learnt javaScript such as variables, loops and arrays. As well as having to research several things that weren't covered in lessons. It also involved developing my ability to Psudocode to help plan before writting code.

## Issues

There was a heavy amount of researched needed to complete this task, and often there were multiple conflicting suggests online. I believe any of those meathods would have worked, however it was hard to decide on which way was best to tackle the coding and which methods to use.
Eventually i settled on a combination of the different things i found online.
